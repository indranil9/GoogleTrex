play google chrome's dinosaur using convolutional neural network.


First of all we create the training data by taking screenshots frame by frame and saving the respective actions with respect to that.
In this problem we have three respective action run,jump and duck. 
Then we the pass the input features through a convolutional neural network and train the model and save the model. 
Then we load the model and predict the actions with respect to the images.
